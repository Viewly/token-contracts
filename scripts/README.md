## distribute.py
### distribute.py is a cli for Minting Tokens.

It has 3 commands that serve different purpose:

1. `import-txs` -> requires a .csv or a .json payout sheet (example: ?) as first parameter, and a second parameter which is the name of the file that it outputs. The output a db (database) file, that is a required parameter for the other commands below.

Usage:
```
$ python distribute.py import-txs payouts.json payouts.db
```
---
2. `payout` -> used for sending the tokens (minting). It requires the contract address, and a database file (generated with import-txs. See above).

Usage:
```
$ python scripts/distribute.py payout \
    --contract-address 0x7cedd8ae603c3513fe7e86be4adb0314b0e8ec50 \
    payouts.db
```
---
3. `verify` -> used for verifying a .db file generated by import-txs. It will verify if the payout distribution succeeded, by checking the blockchain transactions on the network.  

Usage:

```
$ python scripts/distribute.py verify payouts.db
```

### It is also possible to export a database to .csv by running the following command:

```
$ sqlite3 -header -csv payouts.db "select * from txs;" > out.csv
```
